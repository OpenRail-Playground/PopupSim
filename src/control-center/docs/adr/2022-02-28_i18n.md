# Internationalization Library (i18n)

Date: 2022-02-28

## State

Decided

## Context

As apps will possibly be used by non-native German language speakers, it should be possible to switch their language during runtime.
Even if this functionality isn't used initially after forking this RI, it provides an easy way to enrich an application with further languages with a minumum effort.

## Decision(s)

### Library

We will use **[vue-i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-i18n)** as the i18n library as:

- it's recommended for Vue.js applications
- it's actively developed
- it's released as Open Source Library - [Source](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/releases)
- it's sponsored by several big companies- [Source](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/introduction.html)
- it provides vue3 support
- it provides vite support - [Source](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/advanced/sfc.html#vite-plugin-vue-i18n)
- it provides features like pluralization, formatting, localization (l10n)

### translation style

Translations for _vue-i18n_ can be provided either by using a global translation file or by adding the translations as JSON in between to the special `<i18n></i18n>`-Tag in the Single-File-Components (SFC).
The implemented solution uses global YAML-Files with translations across every component.
This will make it easier to collect all texts to translate and enrich the app with more translations for more language more easily.
Also it decouples the translation process from the development process and provides an easy to read and easy to edit format also for non-developers.

## Alternatives

During research there wern't any competitive librarys.
